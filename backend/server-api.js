/**
 * Server Status API
 * This file would be used on the server-side to create an API endpoint
 * that provides real-time server status and player count information.
 * 
 * Implementation example for Node.js with Express:
 */

// Example server implementation (Node.js/Express)
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

// Enable CORS for all routes
app.use(cors());

// Database connection would go here
// const db = require('./database');

// Server monitoring service would go here
// const serverMonitor = require('./server-monitor');

/**
 * GET /api/server-status
 * Returns the current server status and player count
 */
app.get('/api/server-status', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // In a real implementation, you would:
        // 1. Check if your game server is online
        // 2. Get the current player count from your game server
        // 3. Get the maximum player slots from your configuration
        
        // This is where you'd make the actual check to your game server
        // const serverStatus = await serverMonitor.getStatus();
        // const playerCount = await serverMonitor.getPlayerCount();
        
        // For demonstration, we're returning mock data
        const serverStatus = {
            online: true, // This would be the actual server status
            players: {
                current: 212, // This would be the actual current player count
                max: 230      // This would be your server's maximum player slots
            },
            lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()
        };
        
        res.json(serverStatus);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error getting server status:', error);
        res.status(500).json({ 
            error: 'Failed to retrieve server status',
            online: false,
            players: {
                current: 0,
                max: 230
            }
        });
    }
});

// Start the server on port 3000
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server API running on port ${PORT}`);
});

/**
 * Implementation notes:
 * 
 * 1. In a production environment, this would be deployed on your web server
 *    alongside a service that checks your game server status.
 * 
 * 2. You would need to implement actual monitoring for your game server,
 *    which depends on what kind of server you're running (FiveM, etc).
 * 
 * 3. The frontend JavaScript in script.js would make fetch() calls to this API
 *    endpoint to get real-time server status and player count.
 * 
 * 4. For security, you might want to add rate limiting to prevent abuse.
 * 
 * 5. Consider caching the server status for a short period (5-10 seconds)
 *    to avoid hitting your game server with too many status checks.
